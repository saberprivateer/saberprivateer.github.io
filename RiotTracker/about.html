        <h2>About the Tracker</h2>
        <p>As a former Riot Games employee, I've had the privilege of working alongside some of the most talented individuals in the gaming industry. This tracker was born from my deep respect for my former colleagues who have taken the bold step of founding their own studios.</p>
        
        <p>Having witnessed firsthand the innovation and creativity within Riot's walls, I wanted to create a space that celebrates and tracks the entrepreneurial spirit of those who have moved on to create their own gaming ventures. This tracker serves as a testament to the lasting impact of Riot's culture of innovation and the continued influence of its alumni in shaping the future of gaming.</p>
