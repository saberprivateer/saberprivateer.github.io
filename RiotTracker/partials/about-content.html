      <h2>About Riot Games Spawn Tracker</h2>
      <p>This site tracks studios founded by ex-Riot Games employees, including their funding, founders, and games. It's a fun, community-driven project!</p>
      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
      <p>Have news about a company founded by former Rioters? Know of a funding round or game announcement that should be included? I'd love to hear from you!</p>

      <h2>Future Expansion</h2>
      <p>While this tracker currently focuses on Riot Games alumni, I'm interested in exploring similar tracking for other major gaming companies. If you're interested in creating a similar tracker for another gaming company or would like to collaborate on expanding this one, please reach out!</p>
      <p>Some companies we could potentially track:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blizzard Entertainment alumni</li>
        <li>Valve Corporation alumni</li>
        <li>Epic Games alumni</li>
        <li>Bungie alumni</li>
      </ul>
